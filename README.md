# Picture-Matching

Picture-matcing was a Unity game that I made as part of my graduation project in 2019. This game was designed as a simple game for kids with Intellectual disability. Kids would listen to the word (an animal) in Turkish and then select the corresponding picture. There are 30 questions, and you get 1 point for every correct answer. Bellow you will see in-game examples.
